# E-Commerce Insights and Revenue Prediction using PySpark

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict online shopper behavior on an e-commerce platform using PySpark. We employed comprehensive data analysis techniques including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning algorithms to gain insights into customer interactions and predict revenue generation.

## Objectives
- **Understanding Shopper Behavior**: Utilizing EDA and machine learning to decode complex patterns in online shopping data.
- **Revenue Prediction**: Implementing various classification models to predict the likelihood of revenue generation.

## Methodology
1. **Data Analysis & Preprocessing**: Conducting EDA to understand data patterns and preparing data through feature engineering.
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Reducing data dimensionality for efficient analysis.
3. **K-means Clustering**: Segmenting customers based on shopping behavior.
4. **Model Comparison and Selection**:
   - Implementing Logistic Regression, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Random Forest Classifier.
   - Achieving peak accuracy with Gradient-Boosted Trees.

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For large-scale data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization, providing a variety of plotting options.
- **ggplot**: Utilized for its advanced graphical capabilities and aesthetic appeal in visualizations.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Random Forest Classifier for classification tasks.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning and data analysis in understanding and predicting online shopper behavior, with Gradient-Boosted Trees emerging as the most effective model for revenue prediction on the e-commerce platform. Additionally, the K-means clustering algorithm provided valuable insights into customer segmentation, enhancing our understanding of shopper behavior patterns. These results highlight the synergy of using diverse analytical approaches in e-commerce data analysis, offering significant implications for targeted marketing and customer relationship management.
